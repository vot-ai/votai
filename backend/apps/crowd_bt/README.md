# Pairwise Ranking Aggregation in a Crowdsourced Setting

This is an implementation of the algorithms described in [X. Chen, P. N. Bennett, K. Collins-Thompson, and E. Horvitz, “Pairwise
ranking aggregation in a crowdsourced setting,”](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pairwise-ranking-aggregation-in-a-crowdsourced-setting/).

In particular, this implements the online learning strategy as used by the publication's Algorithm 1.
